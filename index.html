<p>The Simpsons is an American animated television sitcom starring the animated Simpson family, which was created by
    Matt Groening. He conceived of the characters in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office and named them after his own
    family members, substituting "Bart" for his own name. The family debuted as shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show on
    April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show called The
    Simpsons, which debuted on December 17, 1989. The show was an early hit for Fox, becoming the first Fox series to
    land in the top 30 ratings in a season (1990).
    The show was controversial from its beginning and has made the news several times. In the early seasons, some
    parents characterized Bart as a poor role model for children and several United States public schools even banned
    The Simpsons merchandise and T-shirts. In January 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush made a speech during his
    re-election campaign in which he said: "We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make
    American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." In 2002, the show was nearly sued
    by the Rio de Janeiro tourist board for creating an unreal image of the city on the show.
    The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and 27, 2007. Previous
    attempts to create a film version of The Simpsons failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and
    production crew members. Eventually, producers Brooks, Groening, Al Jean, Mike Scully, and Richard Sakai began
    development of the film in 2001. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a
    film. The script was re-written over a hundred times, and this creativity continued after animation had begun in
    2006. The film was a box office success, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews.

<p>Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9, 1983)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the
    two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also
    known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a
    charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not
    to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental
    involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for
    horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky
    overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends..
